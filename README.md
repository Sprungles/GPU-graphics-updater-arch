# GPU-graphics-updater-arch
A tool to update the GPU driver to only stable releases on Arch Linux

# Why this tool is necessary
Over the last few years I have been using Arch Linux and have experienced a large amount of incontentment from the 
implementation of graphics drivers on linux. It is mainly due to decision-making made by the mesa development team. 
Some releases are solid, while others are unstable. So, this tool is designed to make it where I don't have to worry about my graphics driver being stable.
